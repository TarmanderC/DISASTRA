DISASTRA
Take back the world from forces of disaster in DISASTRA, an RPG in which you have the power to do what's right...or whatever you please. Take control of the Knight, a celebrated hero of the realm, and command a party of wacky characters in your quest to defeat the forces of nature. Whenever you defeat a boss, however, you must choose whether to kill them and save the people or spare them to reap rewards from Disastra, the mistress of nature. The choice is yours in this adventure!
 
Overview
After waking up from a dream in which Disastra has told him her evil plan, the Knight teams up with his friend the Mage and sets out to defeat her and her minions. As players progress through the game, they will encounter enemies that block their path and must be defeated to progress. In battle, players can choose one of three or four attacks for each playable character. These attacks deal varying amounts of damage, but stronger attacks may also cost the player future turns. It is up to the player to discover how these attacks work and strategically use them to maximize survivability and damage output. Players may heal at any time using one of several beds placed throughout the game, and they may also use Potions that can be received from NPCs or bought at the Shop.
